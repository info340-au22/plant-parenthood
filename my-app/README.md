# Project Description: Plant Parenthood

OUR CURRENT INTERACTIVE FEATURE: filtering on home page is interactive, not the upload feature yet


Our application, Plant Parenthood is driven to help educate plant enthusiasts on what kinds of plants they are able to plant in their backyard to promote gardening and sustainability. With the target audience for our application being plant enthusiasts in the Seattle area, we aim to help locals inspire and motivate their community about gardening and sustainability through this platform in an informative and easy accessible manner. In regards to accessibility, we aim to make sure that the wording on our platform is easy to understand and that the color contrast is enough for people with lower than perfect vision.


Some actions users can do on our platform: 

• Users can filter for whether a plant in their area/location has been planted or not planted, and see favorite ones that they would like to plant in the future
• Users can look up a plant's name and compare it to another plant if they need help on which plant they should plant
• Users can also upload photos of their own plants on the platform inventory to see which ones they have already planted 


This application fosters plant enthusiasts to understand what kinds of plants can be planted in their location/area. Even more, it classifies and personalizes plants you can plant based on your favorites and ones you have not planted. Plant Parenthood sets up user to become more diverse, knowledgable and sustainable, therefore promoting a healthier way of life. 
Plant Parenthood helps plant enthusiasts get started on planting and gardening by recommending plants based on their location, especially people who haven't planted or gardened before. In the future, we hope to implement more social aspects to it such as adding friends to see what plants the both of you can plant together (even if you live in different places!), and implementing a map feature where the user can visually see what kinds of plants can be planted around the country. We also would love to built out a more robust filter with more plant filters such as climate, time of year, personal preference (like color), native, perennial, etc.

We hope local plant enthusiasts can use our platform with ease, knowing that Plant Parenthood strives to provide a comfortable and informative community for people of all backgrounds to engage in. No matter what your level of experience, the platform will help you get started on gardening and planting!
Plant Parenthood is the first step in fostering sustainability and and exploring deeper connections with the local nature and plants around us.

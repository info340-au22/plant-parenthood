            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our application is driven to combat the difficulties and inconveniences of people making friends and developing 
                new social interactions, especially at a post pandemic stage. With the target audience for our application being 
                the students at UW, we aim to connect one another through this platform in a fun and easy accessible manner. 
                With questions worded in particular to any social groups and ranged across diverse backgrounds and experiences, 
                the application will be inclusive to minority groups. For example, instead of questions like “How do you celebrate 
                Thanksgiving?” it will be reworded to “How do you celebrate the upcoming holiday in your culture?”
                <ol>
                    <li>Users are able to respond to the daily prompt by uploading a text and or image in their post.</li>
                    <li>Users can find and connect with their friends so that they can view each other’s responses to the daily prompt.</li>
                    <li>Users can also update their profile image and bio in the profile tab if needed.</li>
                </ol>
                The users of tbh will be able to interact with daily featured tbhs and post their own tbh. 
                The information provided would be from the personal information students have entered in their quizzes, 
                and well as providing other corresponding information regarding others that radiate equivalent ideas. 
                This application fosters students to form deeper connections with new friends that have similar interests or experiences. 
                Even more, it classifies and direct you in forming groups with likeminded people. 
                Tbh sets up user to become more diverse and meet people form many backgrounds, embodying multiple cultures that 
                illuminates their day to day life. 
                “tbh” connects people who do not have the time or energy to explore new ways of interacting. 
                Our program does the grunt work of discovering new ways to socialize in the most rewarding ways. 
                We hope UW students can use our platform with ease, knowing that “tbh” strives to provide a comfortable, 
                fun community for people of all backgrounds to engage in. No matter what your identity, 
                everyone’s daily “tbh” perspective is valuable on this application, and we can each learn a lot from each other! 
                “tbh” is only the first step in exploring the deep connections and unique stories around us.

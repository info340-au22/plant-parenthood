# Project Description: Plant Parenthood

[Access our app here!](https://plant-parenthood-51300.web.app)

Our application, Plant Parenthood is driven to help educate plant enthusiasts on what kinds of plants they are able to plant in their backyard to promote gardening and sustainability. With the target audience for our application being plant enthusiasts in the Seattle area, we aim to help locals inspire and motivate their community about gardening and sustainability through this platform in an informative and easy accessible manner. In regards to accessibility, we aim to make sure that the wording on our platform is easy to understand and that the color contrast is enough for people with lower than perfect vision.


Some actions users can do on our platform: 

1. Users can filter for plants based on their colloquial name, scientific name, color, ideal temperature range, native region, etc.
2. Users can look up a plant's name and compare it to another plant if they need help on which plant they should plant
3. Users can also upload photos of their own plants on the platform inventory to keep a personal album of photos


This application allows plant enthusiasts to understand what kinds of plants can be planted in their location/area. Plant Parenthood helps users to become more diverse, knowledgable and sustainable in what they are planting, therefore promoting a healthier way of life. In the future, we hope to implement more social aspects to it such as adding friends to see what plants the both of you can plant together (even if you live in different places!), and implementing a map feature where the user can visually see what kinds of plants can be planted around the country. We also would love to built out a more robust filter with more plant filters such as climate, time of year, personal preference (like color), native, perennial, etc.

We hope local plant enthusiasts can use our platform with ease, knowing that Plant Parenthood strives to provide a comfortable and informative community for people of all backgrounds to engage in. No matter what your level of experience, the platform will help you get started on gardening and planting! Plant Parenthood is the first step in fostering sustainability and and exploring deeper connections with the local nature and plants around us.
